# Chapter 26 - Philosophical Foundations
_In which we consider what it means to think and whether artifacts could and should ever do so._
## Summary
This chapter has addressed the following issues:
* Philosophers use the term __weak AI__ for the hypothesis that machines could possibly behave intelligent, and __strong AI__ for the hypothesis that such machines would count as having actual minds (as opposed to simulated minds).
* Alan Turing rejected the quesstion "Can machines think?" and replaced it with a behavioral test. He anticipated many objections to the possibility of thinking machines. Few AI researchers pay attention to the Turing Test, preferring to concentrate on their systems' performance on practical tasks, rather than the ability to imimtate humans.
* There is general agreement in modern times that mental states are brain states.
* Arguments for and against strong AI are inconclusive. Few mainstream AI researchers believe that anything significant hinges on the outcome of the debate.
* Consciousness remains a mystery.
* We identified six potential threats to society posed by AI and related technology. We concluded that some of the threats are either unlikely or differ little from threats posed by "uninitelligent" technologies. One threat in particular is worthy of further consideration: that ultraintelligent machines might lead to a future that is very different from today - we may not like it, and at that point we may not have a choice. Such considerations lead inevitably to the conclusion that we must weigh carefully, and soon, the possible consequences of AI research.
